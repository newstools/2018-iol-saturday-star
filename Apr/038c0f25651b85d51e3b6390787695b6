Designer Gert-Johan Coetzee has teamed up with McDonald’s South Africa to mark the 50th birthday of the Big Mac. The collaboration was revealed at a festive event in Sandton, hosted by Nomzamo Mbatha, this week, with a sneak peek at Coetzee’s latest collection. The collection, which will be shown next week at the South African Fashion Week, includes a range of edgy streetwear. Alongside the high-glamour red-carpet show-stoppers, the designer is best known for sending glam casual wear down the ramp. All the proceeds of the exclusive range will go to the Ronald McDonald House Charities, which provide a safe home to families of children receiving specialised hospital treatment. “The Big Mac is a pop culture icon, and we had to celebrate this milestone with something extraordinary. Seeing its iconography interpreted into fashion by a leading designer is rewarding,” said Daniel Padiachy, McDonald’s SA’s chief marketing and communications officer. “This collaboration will directly benefit families who need support during a child’s illness, and the synergy and shared values that made this possible is a foundation that we’re excited to build on,” he said. Coetzee took inspiration from urban-club culture, for a range that includes tinsel jackets, trendy tracksuits, faux fur and blinged-up T-shirts. “It’s comfortable and wearable but still edgy and glam, and there's something for everyone,” the designer said, revealing that the range will include children's items.
