Madikizela Mandela hailed from the village of Mbongweni, Bizana, Pondoloand, and was one of eight children. "She provided encouragement to us throughout the disputes of rightful succession. The fire that burned within her was a warmth to our souls. Her relationship to myself and my family was a constant source of comfort and resilience. "On behalf of the entire nation of AmaMpondo, we express our heartfelt condolences to the immediate family, friends and the movement at large," said Queen Sigcau.
"She fought a good fight and, now that the war is over, it is time for the courageous soldier to go home. Rest in peace Mangutyana." 
Madikizela Mandela died on Monday, at the age of 81, at the Netcare Milpark Hospital after a long illness. She had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year and at her deathbed, was surrounded by her loved ones. On Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa told throngs of mourners who had gathered outside Madikizela Mandela's Soweto home that South Africans were ill prepared for her departure. "The death is a great loss in that she has been one of the strongest women in our struggle who suffered immensely. She was treated badly, was separated from not only her husband but from her children and people as well. She remained ... courageous and stubborn on behalf of the people." Saturday Star
