Food, clothing and bookstalls are lined up a few metres away from the Struggle icon’s home in Orlando West, Soweto. Nkateko Manganyi, 24, said he was helping with the running of a family business and they were there to sell ANC regalia to mourners. “We started coming here on Tuesday. We are selling here because it is next to Winnie Mandela’s house and, as we all know, many people are going come to this house to pay their last respects to her,” Manganyi said. He said business had been slow because news about her death was still “fresh”. Manganyi hopes that sales will pick up over the next few days as more people visit the house. “I’m not saying that it is a good thing that she died but I’m hoping I can use it (her death) to grow my business,” Manganyi said. Zodwa Nyandeni said she had only started selling merchandise in the area yesterday. “We came here because of Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral. I understand that the funeral will be next week, so we will be coming here until she is buried. We usually sell in areas where there are ANC events,” Nyandeni said. She said it was important to look at fashion trends and brand them. Oscar Magagula is an ANC member and usually sells food to comrades at events. “I am here for Mama Winnie. Business will pick up today. I know it will get busy. Comrades go to work and when they knock off, they come here. Yesterday afternoon was busy,” Magagula said. @smashaba
