Since the city released the 2018 roll on February 20 for the period July 1 2018 to June 30 2022, scores of people have expressed their outrage. The increases in rates and tariffs are set to kick in on July 1. With scores of residents up in arms over the valuations, the #JhbRatesMustFall petition started circulating on social media - this as some property owners experienced an increase of up to a staggering 700% in their municipal valuation bill. Selma Lloyd, assistant director for the City of Joburg’s media and public relations, told the Saturday Star that from the opening of the objection period until Thursday afternoon, 26000 objections were filed by property owners. Over the past few weeks, disgruntled residents lodged complaints with the city by visiting 12 assigned walk-in venues, including those in Midrand, Roodepoort, Orlando East, Protea North, Jabulani, Randburg and Lenasia. Others resorted to lodging complaints on the city’s website. Following the widespread outrage over the city’s property valuations, the city granted light relief to around 900000 Joburg property owners who are up in arms over the huge increases in rates and tariffs due to come into effect in July. The City of Joburg this week announced that residents would get a rebate on the first R350000 of their property values - up from R200 000. Meanwhile, the city’s mayoral committee member for finance, Funzela Ngobeni, told our sister paper The Star that residential property statistics showed that 4.61% of properties had decreased in value, while 2.23% of properties had increased between 81% and 100%, and 3.38% of properties had gone up by more than 100%.
