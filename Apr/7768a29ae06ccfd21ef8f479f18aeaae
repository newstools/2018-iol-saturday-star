A shoot-out at East Rand Mall yesterday, which left one person dead and others injured, sent shoppers into a frenzy.
According to a source, one of the gunmen disappeared into the crowd in a bid to escape police custody. He then allegedly hid in stores at the shopping complex in Boksburg. Police and paramedics were unavailable for comment despite several attempts by The Saturday Star. But Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo told Eyewitness News (EWN) that the gunmen were a group of five wanted criminals. He was quoted as saying that police had received a tip-off that they were at the mall and when the officers spotted them, the group had started firing. The confrontation between the police and the men led to one person being shot dead while one of the suspects was wounded. He was taken to hospital where he remains under police guard. According to reports, a woman was also wounded when she was caught in the crossfire. She was airlifted to hospital. Police managed to catch one of the gunmen while the three others escaped in the mall. The Saturday Star
