ACTORS will tell you they suffer for their art. In Charlize Theron’s case, she brought on depression by deliberately gaining 22kg.
In her latest film, Tully, she plays an overweight and overwhelmed mother of two who is struggling while pregnant with another child. The 42-year-old, who is usually a trim size 8, told how she gorged on fast food, including burgers and milkshakes for breakfast and macaroni and cheese meals at 2am to get ready for the part. “I wanted to feel what this woman felt, and I think that was a way for me to get closer to her and get into that mindset," she says. "It was a huge surprise to me. I got hit in the face pretty hard with depression. "For the first time in my life I was eating so much processed foods and I drank way too much sugar. I was not that fun to be around on this film." In an interview with Enter- tainment Tonight, Theron, who also gained weight to play a serial killer in the 2003 film Monster and won an Oscar for that role, adds: “The first three weeks are always fun because you’re just like a kid in a candy store. "So it was fun to go and have breakfast at In-N-Out (burger chain) and have two milkshakes. And then after three weeks, it’s not fun any more. Like, all of a sudden you’re just done eating that amount and then it becomes a job.” Theron explains that for Tully she would have food by her bed, including macaroni and cheese, and would set her alarm for the middle of the night to have another meal, just to maintain the weight. The star says it took a year-and-a-half to shed the weight and describes the dieting process as “hell”. “I was worried. I was like, this is taking a really long time. Because on Monster, I just didn’t snack for five days (to lose the weight afterwards) and I was fine. "You know, your body at 27 is a little different than your body at 43.” - Daily Mail
