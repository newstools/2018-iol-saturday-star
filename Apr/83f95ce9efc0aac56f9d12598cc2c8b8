Eddie Bisset, managing director of Herbex holding company Newgroup Holdings, said the company’s many testimonials were “real and factual and supported by an affidavit signed by the featured customers”. “The ASA has not been mandated by the former Medicines Control Council - now the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) - to assess the efficacy or safety of complementary medicines. “With a proud 25-year history of supplying health and slimming products to South African consumers, Herbex Health boasts many success stories from individuals who have used their products to lose weight, and keep it off.” Last week, the ASA banned a Herbex advert featuring a personal customer testimonial, claiming it misrepresented the weight loss efficacy of the product. It was consumer activist Dr Harris Steinman who complained about a television commercial for its product Fat Attack. The commercial features the testimonial of a woman who claimed she lost 43kg since 2006 using Herbex slimmers. “I have kept the weight off for 10 years. Herbex has completely changed my life. I am more confident and feel like I can do anything.” The commercial then shows before and after photos of her. Bisset said Herbex  products were carefully researched and formulated by industry professionals before going to market, and all manufacturers were compliant and properly certificated. “Herbex is committed to servicing customers and supplying products which would improve and enrich their lives,” he said. - Staff Reporter Saturday Star
