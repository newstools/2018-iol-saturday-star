Pam Golding, pictured, died last week in her Constantia home at the age of 89, surrounded by her family. Among the mourners at the memorial service were Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, who also said a prayer at the service, businessman Patrice Motsepe and his wife Dr Precious Moloi-Motsepe, as well as Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille. Golding was described as a woman of persistence, tenacity and an “eternal optimist”. Motsepe said Golding “was a special and unique woman who touched the lives of so many she had a way of making order out of disorder”. Tutu described her as “an amazing human being”. Golding was a trustee of the Desmond Tutu Peace Trust. Her son Peter Golding said his mother was unstoppable and just “got on with it”. Her other son, Dr Andrew Golding, who took over the reins from his mother to head Pam Golding Properties, described her as tenacious, friendly and humble. In the 1970s, with no start-up capital, Golding started her business from the garage of her Newlands home and went on to build an empire that today has 300 offices in Africa, as well as offices in Europe and in Mauritius. Although Golding had retired from active management of Pam Golding Properties, she was still the life president of the group.
