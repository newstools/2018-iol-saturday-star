These are the heart-warming words Theuns Botha once told Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Botha, who is in the blanket manufacturing business, had for years been itching to honour Madikizela-Mandela for her sacrifices in liberating South Africa. He met the Struggle icon for the first time in February 2015 after trying for three years to get through to her. Their “mother-son” relationship just grew from then on.  Botha first gave Madikizela-
Mandela the blanket with her face which is the same picture which is on the cover of her biography 491 Days. “For many years I said to myself that the best way that I can honour her is on a blanket. I cannot imagine a person who would not want a picture of themselves on a blanket. “The blanket is personalised. You can see her eyes, they are striking,” Botha said. The 81-year-old died in hospital on Monday. On March 16, Botha and his team presented Madikizela-
Mandela with a newly manufactured blanket with her signature on it. “She was so happy. She was so attached to the project. She had lot of energy. I had her on speed dial. I would call her any time and so could she. We would talk for hours and laugh.” He recalled how two months ago he and his wife, Huey Jin, had spent hours in Madikizela-Mandela’s home and for about three hours they had been in her bedroom talking and laughing. “It was such a special moment. We spent so much time with her it feels like we have known her for a lifetime,” he said. Botha said he last saw her on March 19. He said plans to launch the commemorative blanket had been finalised. It will be held in Diepkloof, Soweto, on May 27. “She will definitely be there in spirit. I know that wherever she is, she is demanding that this should go ahead. “We are going to celebrate her life and I’m happy that she was able to see the blanket and wanted it to be a success,” Botha said. @smashaba @LindileSifile
