Two correctional services officers appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court yesterday for allegedly aiding the escape of the pri-
soners on April 9. The two were each granted bail of R5000 and are expected back in court on May 3. Three other officials had been placed on suspension pending an international investigation, Correctional Services Department spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said. “The investigation is ongoing and other officials could be identified and arrested," Nxumalo said. The escapees had broken out by removing iron bars in their cell, he said. They had made their way down a pipe shaft before breaking a hole in a brick wall. It was suspected they had tools to effect their break-out. Ten of the escapees were still at large, he said. The Gauteng Department of Correctional Services said that from January last year it had dealt with 1036 disciplinary cases for misconduct. This had resulted in 42 officials being dismissed. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-
Malobane welcomed the arrests of the correctional services officers. “The alleged conduct of the two officials is a serious contravention of ethics and the code of conduct for those employed in the criminal justice system. Members are supposed to display the highest level of integrity in discharging their duties. "As government, we will continue with our mandate to root out this immoral behaviour and ensure anyone found guilty will face the full might of law.” Saturday Star
