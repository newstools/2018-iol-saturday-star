Yesterday,  Inspector Ayanda Zulu, 39, was attacked by two men outside her house in Palm Springs, Evaton, while on her way to work in the early hours of the morning. Zulu was shot twice during the incident and the criminals fled with her 9mm firearm and two magazines of bullets. Johannesburg Metro Police Depatrment (JMPD) spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the mother-of-four was shot in the chest and chin, killing her instantly. “No arrests have been made as yet. However, a strange vehicle was seen in the area and police are following up on information,” said Minnaar. Mayor of the Joburg Herman Mashaba has condemned the attack and vowed to bring the criminals to book. “The sad passing of our colleague is a personal loss to me as I am responsible for this government and its thousands of employees. “There is no fairness when a senseless crime is committed and an innocent person - be they a resident or public servant - dies as a result of crime. “Today’s loss of one of our own is a strong reminder that we cannot stand idly by and do nothing as criminals terrorise our communities.” He said JMPD chief David Tembe had an enormous task on his shoulders to find the senseless killers. “Through the city manager’s office, our police chief has been instructed to work closely with the SAPS to ensure tragedies such as these are investigated and culprits tried with the full might of the law,” Mashaba said. Public safety MMC councillor Michael Sun called for a specialised task team to be formed between the metro police in Joburg and Tshwane and the SAPS to investigate such murders. In January, Alinah Mao-sheng and Winnie Mokgolo were killed by a drunk driver while administering sobriety tests during a roadblock in Fourways. In February, David Ratshikhopha was shot dead by hijackers, and off-duty warden Alfred Molomo was shot dead when he went to assist a shop owner in Ivory Park. No arrests have been made in either incident. @Zwane_2li2ls
