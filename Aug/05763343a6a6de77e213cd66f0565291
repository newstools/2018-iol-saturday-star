It would be at times like this that the whole family would visit. Quickly, the planned quiet weekend would turn into a carnival of enjoyment. The adults would always be arguing about one thing or another and the children chasing each other through the garden enjoying the joy of family. When it came to the big lunch, Bankrupt pudding was on the table. This sweet, tasty cinnamon and ginger dessert, drizzled with creamy custard, was a sure way to delight everyone - an absolutely fantastic way to end the weekend. With few ingredients, the dessert is quick and easy to make, and the whole family can enjoy it.  PS: I was always the one sneaking into the fridge to get a last bite before going to bed.  BANKRUPT PUDDING Serves 4 ½ cup smooth apricot jam ½ cup butter 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 1 cup flour 1 cup sugar 1 tsp cinnamon ½ tsp ginger 3 cups water  METHOD Place the water, sugar, cinnamon and ginger into a large pot. Heat over a high temperature until it boils. Place the apricot jam and butter into a small pot. Heat over a medium temperature until butter and jam are both melted; add bicarbonate of soda and stir. The mixture will foam up, add flour. Keep stirring until the mixture turns into a dough-like consistency. Once the sugar mixture has boiled, turn the heat down to low. Spoon the dough into the syrup mixture about a tablespoon at a time. Place the lid on to the pot and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not lift the lid during this time. Serve this simple and easy-to-make dessert with hot custard. The Saturday Star
