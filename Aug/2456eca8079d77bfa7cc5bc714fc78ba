Throughout his political career that spans more than 60 years he has been consistent in listening to all sides of the stories. Be it the peasants, people of high erudition or youth. Inkatha’s two-day policy summit has the art of accommodating the fresh mandate. The IFP and its leader know that people need jobs, better education and to raise their children in a safe and normal society. We do not doubt that if the IFP could be given a chance to lead and govern this country it would be a breath of fresh political air in every nook and cranny of our societal structures. Through its policies on economy, unemployment and job creation, education and development skills as well as crime and security, the IFP has hit the nail on the head. Most of our country’s problems emanate from the ruling party’s inability to address these matters in a pragmatic manner. Voters should think twice in giving the IFP a chance to do what is good for them as voters, their children and children’s children. Throughout his political leadership Prince Buthelezi has never been an opportunist, but instead he keeps on doing what will benefit this country. He hates quick-fix solutions. Buthelezi summed it up well during Tuesday’s press conference: “The IFP believes that an opportunity exists to rescue our country from the brink of disaster. If people’s needs are not put first right now, if we don’t do what is needed immediately, it will be decades before the present damage can be put right.” Indeed, voting for opportunistic political parties will not help this country. Most politicians, even on the question of land, say what they want to, instead of facing realities. They do not mind the repercussions of their lies and empty promises.
