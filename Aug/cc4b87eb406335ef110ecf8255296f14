Your favourite Saturday read is getting a facelift. From next week, we will bring you an updated, modernised newspaper which we hope you will come to know and love, and travel this new journey with us into the digital future. The new design will be neat and easy to navigate, allowing us to interface our newspaper with our digital content on the Saturday Star, IOL websites and our social media platforms. With Independent Media’s motto of “Digital First, Print Best” in mind, the new-look Saturday Star will still capture the big stories of the day and the week. We know that Saturdays are about home, family and lifestyle, so don’t miss the beautiful supplement “Affluence”, which brings together the best of past features such as travel and puzzles, and adds great new content for your enjoyment. The redesign is about celebrating our history and tradition. It’s about looking to the future where we make your total Saturday Star experience unlike anything else that’s available in the market, from the front page to the back, from your much-loved print product to augmented reality and the latest in digital technology. We invite you to send us your comments on the new design to saturday letters@inl.co.za The Saturday Star
