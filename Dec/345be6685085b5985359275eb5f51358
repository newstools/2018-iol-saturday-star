Durban - AFTER making a stunning debut on Twitter with a video tweet on Friday, former president Jacob Zuma has released another video tweet assuring South Africans “It’s me, Jacob Zuma”.

Some on Twitter were not convinced the account was really that of the former president after some curious tweets on the account. WATCH: Zuma’s It’s Me Video here Taking to Twitter on Saturday, Zuma said he heard people were doubting it was really him behind the account. So he recorded another video to allay fears the public was being misled.  “Hello once again. I hear that some people are doubting whether I have joined the social media. Yes it is me, I have joined, it is real. I am sure it is going to take time for people to get used to me being part of the conversations in the social media and I know that of course some people have been using some fake accounts on my name, but now it is me. I am there and of course with time people will realise that I am engaging on the matters,” said Zuma on the twitter video.  Zuma also indicated he was on social media to correct certain narratives which “needed to be responded to”.  “I have not been engaging for a long time, and I just thought it was high time I do so. You will get used to me, I am part of the people and I must be with them and I must be in the conversation to correct things, and to also respond to things that need to be responded to. It’s me, Jacob Zuma,” he said. Meanwhile, this is how some on social media responded to Zuma’s video. Daily News
