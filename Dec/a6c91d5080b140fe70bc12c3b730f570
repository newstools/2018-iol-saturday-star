Star-studded wishes for a merry Christmas from designer to the stars Gert-Johan Coetzee and his good friend, TV presenter and personality Minnie Dlamini-Jones. Making fashion magic together comes naturally to these two. Coetzee has had a busy 2018, working with one iconic brand after another. There was the street wear range for McDonald’s to celebrate the Big Mac’s 50th birthday; his appearance on Mzanzi Magic’s Project Runway as the mentor of the contestants; and the big names for whom he created designer looks. This includes the likes of former Miss Universe Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters to Beyoncé’s father Dr Mathew Knowles and his wife Gena. Coetzee also dress the one and only Oprah Winfrey, who appeared at the Global Citizen Festival earlier this month in a stunning yellow GJC kaftan. Celebrating the festive season in the Coetzee household means a lot of glamour, and this season the theme is rose-gold and muted pink, with a Gert-Johan Coetzee gown delivering a pop of red!
