On Friday Earthlife Africa and academics welcomed Ramaphosa's comment, saying it signalled a change in the government's attitude. The official opposition also backed Ramaphosa. President Jacob Zuma has been pushing a nuclear deal for several months and changed energy ministers three times last year, leading to accusations from the opposition that he wanted to seal the nuclear deal soon. Earthlife Africa director Makoma Lekalakala said: “What I understand is that Ramaphosa is reiterating what has been said in the past, that South Africa does not have the money to build nuclear." She said this view had been echoed by various ministers of finance and energy experts. In a paper released yesterday, titled South Africa's Electricity Choice, Professor Anton Eberhard and Dr Amory Lovins of UCT's Graduate School of Business said nuclear power was not viable in South Africa. They argued that despite several signals that the project would not work, the government had been pushing it. “The South African government's obsession over the past decade with nuclear power may finally come to an end with a new president and administration committed to restoring good governance and securing reliable electricity supply at least cost to support economic growth and development,” wrote the academics. “The inherent complexity of nuclear procurement, financing and especially construction, means no new nuclear- generated electricity could flow for at least a decade, even with immediate procurement, and then only at prices well above other electricity options.” The DA and African Christian Democratic Party said a nuclear project would collapse the fiscus. Experts have estimated that the project would cost up to R1 trillion.
