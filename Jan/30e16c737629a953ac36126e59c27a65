It is almost that time of the year when social media is overwhelmed by parents posting pictures of their children's first day at school.
Another version of these pictures, and sometimes videos, are the ones with first-time Grade 1 pupils crying because they do not like this new place. Parenting expert Nikki Bush shares how to help your child ease into the new academic year and reach their full potential despite the change in environment which, she says, often affects a child’s emotional well-being. “It is important to ensure your child is emotionally ready for school and adapts well to their new routine,” said Bush. First-term jitters are still a real thing for some children, especially those who are entering the classroom for the first time. Bush said the change in a child's usual environment - in this case a new school - pre-primary, primary and high school, and even moving on to the next grade mean they find it daunting and stressful to adapt. “Parents the world over agree, when kids are fretful and uneasy, mom and dad are too,” she said. To help pupils cope better, Bush said activities that involve movement are highly beneficial. This raises endorphins and puts them in a better mood. She suggests interactive movement games such as hide-and-seek. Quality time with mom or dad also eliminates stress, she said, and are extremely important to help the young ones relax. Here games fit for the entire family, such as football, hopscotch, board games or Lego are suggested. “Parent-child interaction has a calming effect on kids. It means bonding as a family, which also acts as a channel of support for children. They feel safe and secure,” she said. When it come to dropping the child at school, Bush said parents need to be flexible. “If the child is more anxious with one parent than the other, simply swop drop-off roles and don't feel guilty about it.” The Saturday Star
