This is a total lunar eclipse, also known as a “blood moon” due to the coppery, reddish colour of the moon as it passes through the Earth's shadow. In a lunar eclipse, the sunlight that makes it around Earth passes through the atmosphere and is refracted towards the moon. Blue light is filtered out, leaving the moon looking reddish during an eclipse. This will be the second full moon this month, which makes this eclipse unusual and it is also a larger-than-normal full moon (a “super moon”), making it even more special. Parts of the world are expected to witness 2018’s rare “blue blood moon”, countries such as Asia (China and Japan), Australia, Pacific and western North America, leaving Africans out of the fun. According to local astronomer Dr Claire Flanagan, people in South Africa will not be able to witness the first blood moon of 2018 because we are on the wrong side of the planet. “It is happening from about 2pm-5pm (CAT). Around the time it happens, the moon is below our horizon,” said Flanagan. The astronomer told The Star that South Africa would only be able to witness their lunar eclipse on July 27. Flanagan said there were no dangers in gazing at an eclipse of the moon. - Additional reporting from The Conversation
