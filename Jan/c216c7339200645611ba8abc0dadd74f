In November, the Randburg Magistrate's Court found Momberg guilty for using the k-word 48 times against four police officers who were trying to help her after a smash-and-grab incident. Momberg became infamous last year when video footage and audio recordings of her using the slur went viral. Since her conviction, the sentencing proceedings have so far seen Momberg take to the stand to defend her actions. But throughout her cross-examination at the hands of prosecutor Yusuf Baba, Momberg spent most of the time refusing to admit she had even used the k-word. She only acknowledged her slurs after she was confronted with a transcript of the case against her at the Equality Court, where she said she had possibly used it between one and four times. During the Equality Court proceedings, Momberg had conceded through her lawyers she had used hate speech, that she was willing to take sensitivity training and community service. The court ultimately asked her to also pay a R100000 fine. However, during sentencing proceedings in her criminal matter, Momberg was adamant the Equality Court judge had “unintentionally” been wrong in convicting her. Yesterday, the court was set to receive a pre-sentencing report from a social worker who had interviewed Momberg, with the social worker expected to take the stand as a possible defence witness. The report was likely to suggest what sentence would be appropriate for the real estate agent. However, the court heard the social worker had fallen seriously ill and needed at least four to five weeks of recovery before the report could be written. This meant the case was postponed to March for the report. Throughout the criminal proceedings, Baba has hinted in his arguments that he believes Momberg should be given a prison sentence for her crimen injuria conviction, which would be a first in South African law.
