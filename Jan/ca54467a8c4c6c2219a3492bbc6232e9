Nomvula Ramonotsi, 36, was unresponsive during the short proceedings at the Protea Glen Magistrate's Court yesterday. Ramonotsi will know next week whether she will be granted bail. She was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly strangling her 74-year-old foster mother in Central Western Jabavu.  It was alleged that Ramo-
notsi lived with her corpse in her house for five days. A relative jumped the wall of the home to see whether the victim was inside, after she had not been seen for several days.  Neighbours alleged that Ramonotsi had lived with her foster family for over 20 years. According to a neighbour, Ramonotsi’s foster father died in 2015 and she took over the family taxi business.  “Nomvula is someone I grew up with. She was spoilt and well off," said the neighbour, who did not wish to be named. "I don’t know where things went wrong, but she started telling neighbours that she was being mistreated by her mother." Relatives have refused to speak to the media. They have also told neighbours not to speak to reporters. It was unclear when the burial would take place. Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini confirmed the case, but said he could not comment because the matter was being handled by the courts.   @Siphumelele_K
