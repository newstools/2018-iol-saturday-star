The humble boere biskuit has gone global, according to economist Wandile Sihlobo, who tweeted a couple of interesting export facts about this local-is-lekker treat. In 2017, South Africa exported 1184 tons of rusks and a third of that ended up in Namibia. Considering our neighbours also have a love for biltong and some claim a South African ancestry, it is not surprising they have taste for rusks as well. The next biggest consumer of rusks is Botswana, which accounted for 17% of the total. The UK, with its large South African expat community, dunked their way through 130 tons of rusks in 2017. What is not known is how the Brits take their rusks. Is it after a dunking in coffee or in that most British of drinks, tea? Australia also consumed about 130 tons of rusks last year. Next on the list are Zambia and Zimbabwe, which each consumed 5% of total rusk exports. New Zealand took 3% of the share, followed by Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique and Swaziland with 2% each. The rest of the world accounts for 10% of rusk exports. The Saturday Star
