It is believed the man started abusing the child when she was just five years old. The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the 10-year-old girl, is also being charged with sexual grooming, exposure of a child to pornography and sexual assault. The accused is alleged to have moved to Verulam - about 30km inland of Durban - from Johannesburg six months ago with the child. The girl’s biological mother and father are both dead. The court heard that the case was brought to the police’s attention when the girl was beaten and chased out of the room she was sharing with her stepfather. She approached a neighbour and spoke about the alleged abuse she had suffered. “Vibrators were confiscated, DVDs, dildos from the accused,” investigating officer Nevarge Lutchminarain told the court. The suspect allegedly used the sex toys on the young girl. Lutchminarain further told magistrate Irfaan Khalil that he believed the accused was a flight risk and should be denied bail because he had no fixed address or identity documents. He also believed that incarceration would ensure the safety of the accused, who had been threatened with violence by some community members. “They have assaulted him. He has opened a criminal case against the community, so we are also opposing bail for his own safety as well,” said Lutchminarain. “He is not safe out there.” The bail hearing will continue tomorrow. The girl is currently being kept in a place of safety. - African News Agency (ANA)
