“Ice cream as we know it seems to have emerged in 17th century France. It seems like the French have always been full of good ideas although a Roman emperor is said to have sent runners into the mountains for snow to be flavoured with juices.   Home-made ice cream 4 tsp coffee granules 3 tbs brandy 1 tin condensed milk 4 egg whites 2 cups cream whipped 150g Whispers chocolate ½ cup macadamia nuts, roughly chopped  Method In a large bowl, stir coffee and brandy together until the coffee is dissolved, add condensed milk, keep stirring until all ingredients are evenly mixed. Beat egg white until stiff, fold into coffee mixture. Fold in cream add whispers and macadamia nuts. Place in the freezer for at least four hours before serving. Tip: You could add any of your favourite treats to this recipe such as smarties, sultanas or different caramel nuts. There is nothing quite as wonderful as pasta with bolognese sauce on a chilly winter evening. Ensure that the pasta you select is made from durum wheat. Good quality pasta also does not stick together when cooked. I
always drizzle a little olive oil
over the pasta after draining the water. It adds a lovely flavour to the pasta. Last tip: Do not overcook the pasta; follow the instructions on the packaging, as it is product specific. The Saturday Star
