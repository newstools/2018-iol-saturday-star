In young children, a host of checks are performed to ensure they are meeting their milestones. An eye test is an important yearly milestone test. A childâ€™s brain is highly adaptive, both positively and negatively, and the brain needs to learn how to use the eyes optimally. Therefore, the longer a visual problem remains untreated, the more the brain will respond negatively and making adjustments can get harder. Lambinon Optometrists offer eye tests done with some of the best equipment on the market to assist with the best eye care for your child.  The Saturday Star and Lambinon Optometrists are giving away a pair of Julbo kiddies frames, and an eye test to the value of R3000.
