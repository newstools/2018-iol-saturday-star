Fredie Blom, from Cape Town, has been smoking “pills”, local cigarettes made from tobacco wrapped in newspaper, for decades. But after celebrating his 114th birthday recently, Blom -recognised as the unofficial  “world’s oldest man” - is on a mission to prove it’s never too late to change. “Every day I still smoke two to three ‘pills’. I use my own tobacco because I don’t smoke cigarettes,” he told the BBC. “The urge to smoke is so strong. “Sometimes I tell myself I’m going to stop, but it’s just me lying to myself. “My chest chases me to have a puff and I’m forced to make a ‘pill’. “I blame the devil for that because he’s so strong.” Blom is a former farmworker who, at 114, is believed to be the world’s oldest living man. However, he is yet to be verified by the Guinness World Records that has strict criteria for verifying age claims. In April, the Guinness World Records named Masazo Nonaka the oldest living man at the age of 112. Despite his smoking habit, Blom says he believes he will live a few more years. “I feel very healthy, I’m good,” he said. “My heart is strong but it’s only my legs that are giving in - I can’t walk the way I used to.” Blom credits his faith for his longevity. He said God would decide when he eventually passes away. “He’s got all the power. I have nothing. I can drop over any time but He holds me.” - Daily Mail
