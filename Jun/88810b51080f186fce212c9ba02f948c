New research by Oxford University published in the journal Science this week has revealed the environmental cost of food by studying the land use area of over 38000 farms in 119 countries and 1600 processors, packaging types, retailers and consumption. The authors also studied the production of greenhouse-gas emissions, nutrient build-up and land acidification. “Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change,” wrote the authors of “Reducing food's environmental impacts through producers and consumers”. Their research shows that sourcing protein from plants, nuts and pulses - and adopting a vegan lifestyle - best protects the environment. “Our findings support an approach where producers monitor their impacts meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts to consumers.”
