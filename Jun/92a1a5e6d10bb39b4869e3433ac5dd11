Electronic cigarettes are becoming increasingly popular with smokers who are looking for "healthier" alternatives. And now the device has caught the eye of teenagers and even adolescents who are experimenting with vaping.
Experts say this is partly because of the appealing flavours of the liquid which is added to the vaping devices. Some of the most popular include fruit flavours, mint, coffee as well as dessert choices such as bubblegum, cotton candy and caramel. Manufacturers and distributors of e-cigarettes and related products such as the flavours have put various strategies in place to prevent those who are underage from purchasing these products. This includes the use of an age restrictor on e-cigarette company websites, visible disclaimer for the nicotine found in the products and using payment methods only available to those over the age of 18. The Heart and Stroke Foundation South Africa warns that although e-cigarettes are considered a healthier alternative to conventional cigarette smoking, this does not mean itâ€™s healthy. This is because e-cigarettes still contain traces of nicotine and other harmful substances. Get a copy of The Saturday Star tomorrow for the full story.
