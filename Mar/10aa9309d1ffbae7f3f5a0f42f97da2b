Video footage at last week's Test at Kingsmead Stadium shows De Kock and Warner getting into an altercation as the players walked up a narrow staircase to the dressing rooms during the tea interval on Sunday. Warner has claimed that De Kock made a “vile and disgusting” remark about his wife. Both players were punished for the bust-up, with Warner fined 75%of his match fee and De Kock 25%. Warner was also given three demerit points, meaning he will be banned if he gets one more within the next year. Warner admitted that he let his emotions take over after confronting De Kock. He said he was used to taking flak from fans and opposition players, but claimed De Kock’s remark crossed a line. “I was probably out of line I regret the way it played out. But I’ll always stick up for my family. When it comes to family or racism comments, that’s just a no-go zone,” Warner said. De Kock is yet to respond to the claims made by Warner. The Saturday Star
