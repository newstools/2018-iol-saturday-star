The Gauteng department of education yesterday said it was investigating the circumstances surrounding an incident in which a pupil was filmed in a class pelting a teacher with an exercise book.
The video has gone viral on social media. Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said the incident had reportedly happened at a school in Sedibeng. “Our preliminary investigation revealed that the said incident occurred at Three Rivers Secondary School in Sedibeng,” Mabona said. “We immediately dispatched officials to investigate this incident accordingly. “We can confirm that the officials from the Psycho Social Support Team have already started with the counselling process of all pupils and educators this morning,” said Mabona. Mabona said the department had also offered counselling to the affected educator through the Employee Wellness Programme and the process to take the pupil through a disciplinary hearing had commenced and appropriate sanction would be recommended. “We urge all our learners to refrain from acts of misconduct in schools and implore parents to assist the department in instilling learner discipline in and outside the school environment,” said Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi.
