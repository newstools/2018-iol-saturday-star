Liverpool FC legends Robbie Fowler, John Barnes and Steve McManaman are heading to Johannesburg.
The trio will be in the country next week to commemorate the 100th birthday of former President Nelson Mandela.
The former Reds will be hosting a dinner in Joburg with part of the proceeds from the dinner going towards several charitable causes, including ‘The House Group’ in support of young girls who are survivors of human trafficking. 
The visit themed the #Liverpool4Madiba Experience will encompass a three-day tour in South Africa which includes a press conference, a gala dinner with fans and a coaching clinic with 250 underprivileged children to be hosted at the Metrostars Football Development Centre in Benoni.
The City of Liverpool has always held Madiba close to their hearts. And as a way of commemorating the life of  one of the worlds most famous icons, the City of Liverpool plans to honour  Mandela by placing a permanent memorial of the leader.
The memorial artwork which will be created on the lake island of Toxteth Park and launched in June 2018,  will be known as Mandela Island and the bridge linking the island with the park will be called Freedom Bridge.  
As a city Liverpool applauds and endorses Nelson Mandela’s fight for equal freedom for all and the Liverpool legends are keen to lend their support to this worthwhile initiative hence this campaign is perfectly themed the #Liverpool4Madiba Experience #Freedom4All
There is a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet these Liverpool legends, with limited tickets on sale and going fast.
Tickets are R2500 per ticket and include drinks & 5 course dinner. The gala dinner will take place on Wednesday 21st March 2018 at the Hilton Hotel in Sandton and is sponsored by ‘Favor Energy Drink’, who are honouring Mandela’s service to South Africa. The Saturday Star
