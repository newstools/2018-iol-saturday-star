Hundreds of South African cricket fans turned up yesterday brandishing Sonny Bill Williams masks to taunt David Warner following the batsman’s altercation with Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock during the first Test in Durban. Williams, the All Blacks midfielder, and Warner’s now wife, Candice Warner, were involved in a drunken toilet cubicle encounter in a Sydney hotel in 2007. A cellphone photo of the pair in a compromising position, taken by a witness reaching under the cubicle, was posted online and made headlines around the world. Ground staff at St George's Park were specifically instructed to confiscate all Sonny Bill masks yesterday, but plenty of cricket fans still managed to sneak them in. It didn't seem to throw Warner off too much, however, as he top-scored for Australia with 63 as the Aussies reached 243 all out on the first day of the second Test. Read more in the paper.
