Food Forward SA collects edible surplus food from supermarkets, manufacturers and wholesalers, and distributes it to hundreds of organisations that collectively feed thousands of hungry people daily. However, this aid does not reach all homeless people. Tebogo Mpufane of the Tshwane Homelessness Forum and Kopano Manyano of God the Founder Centre for the Homeless said they were angry that, even after pleading with supermarkets to donate surplus food to the homeless, the retailers still threw it away. “I have pleaded with large retailers to give us the previous day’s bread rolls, vegetables and other food, which they throw out, but they don’t want to," Mpufane said. “Instead, they throw away the food, even after I have given them documents to show I run a legitimate organisation." A representative of a large supermarket, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, said staff were aware of Mpufane’s requests, but they could not assist him because giving people surplus food was against the store's policy. He admitted that day-old bread was thrown out. During a visit to the Heatherly dump site in Mamelodi East last week, a vagrant described the food brought by trucks from food outlets as "fresh" and "like gold". Statistics SA last year re-
vealed that a large number of children under the age of two were underweight and suffered from severe malnutrition. The CSIR quantified the financial burden of food loss and waste in the country as being at R61.5billion, or 2.1% of the national gross domestic product.
