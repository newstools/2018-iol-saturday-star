It is the long weekend. If you are looking for something interesting to put on the braai, try this awesome recipe. The dishcloth keeps in the moisture, the hard wood gives the meat a wonderful smoked flavour; definitely one of my favourite recipes.
It is extremely important to use hard wood in this recipe to get excellent results. Enjoy the holidays. Until next week. Smoked Beef Fillet Serves 6 1.5kg beef fillet 1 dishcloth ¼ cup course salt 2 tbsp ground black pepper 3 cups red wine Hard wood for the fire Method Make a fairly large fire as you will need quite a few coals to cook the meat. Soak the dishcloth in red wine. Crust meat with salt and pepper. Wrap the fillet in the red-wine dishcloth. Place the meat between the coals; ensure the meat is covered completely with coals. Allow to cook for 20 to 30 minutes; test with a meat thermometer. Temperature should be 50ºC for medium rare. Remove from the fire; allow to rest for 20 minutes. Crack off the burnt dishcloth, slice and serve. @flyingchantel The Saturday Star
