RABBIE SERUMULA Where are the soothsayers who predicted the demise of print media? I just want to talk.
Now, you probably thought, since this idea that 95 percent of all content on the web will be video by 2020, it means print will surely meet its maker. Then Augmented Reality (AR) comes through and says, “hold my beer”.  
Yes, videos were complicated and expensive to produce while podcasts were still thinking of becoming 'a thing' when the idea of print dying erupted. 
But listen to the screen of your smartphone, you will hear AR speaking. It whispers to print media, “follow your consumers”. What it is prophesying in this message is that print is being resuscitated. 
Technology is moving at the speed of no forgiveness. So forget that exclusivity print had since the 17th century to before its death was foreseen. For newspapers to compete with the digital economy, it is worse that wielding a butter knife in a bazooka fight. Thus strategising on how to be part of that economy is a must for survival. AR is part of that strategy. Bring your smartphone and tell the soothsayers that readers, subscribers and advertisers alike can now enjoy and benefit from exclusive visual content straight from a hard copy of the newspaper. 
Independent Media in partnership with Augmenta bring your copy of the paper to live.
