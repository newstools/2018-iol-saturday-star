Instead of spending hours in the kitchen preparing food, you can easy rustle up Ma Baker's favourite potatoes. This week I found myself having a little impromptu dinner. Luckily, being South African, we always have potatoes in the kitchen. Simple, easy recipes allow you to have more fun. Ma Baker is a girl's best friend.
Ingredients Ma Bakerâ€™s favourite potatoes 8 small potatoes 6 tbsp butter melted 2 tbsp potato spice 6 tbsp Knorr French salad dressing Method Pierce potatoes with a fork, place in a plastic bag, pop into the microwave for 2 minutes on high (time will vary according to the size of the potatoes). Ensure the potatoes are cooked. If you are not a microwave fan, pop the potatoes into a pot of hot water, boil for 10-12 minutes. Cut four slits half-way through the potato. Drizzle with butter and French dressing, sprinkle potato spice over the top. Place under the oven griller for 10 minutes or until potatoes appear golden and crispy, I finish off my potatoes with a little dash of balsamic reduction.
