Zuma is expected to appear at the Durban High Court on April 6
where he will face 16 charges for 700 counts of corruption, money laundering, fraud and racketeering relating to the controversial arms deal. A black caucus, made up of business forums including the National Funeral Practitioners Association of South Africa (Nafupa SA), Delangokubona Business Forum and the National Taxi Alliance, is spearheading a national campaign to bolster support for Zuma. Speaking on behalf of the business forums under the banner ‘100% behind Zuma’, Nkosentsha Shezi, the secretary-general of Nafupa SA, said the aim was to create a platform for every citizen to be able to show support for the former statesman. “There are many people who feel let down by the manner in which president Zuma is being treated, having championed total emancipation for blacks through land expropriation without compensation, free tertiary education for working-class children and radical economic transformation,” Shezi said. He added that the forum would be providing logistical support including transportation, food and sound systems. “President Zuma is a national figure. People are saying we are 100% behind JZ, and we will be there in numbers to support him. We may see thousands of people descending on Durban. “We are going to be visible in the streets of Durban and in court to say thank you to Msholozi, and in spite of everything that has happened, we are behind you,” he said. Zuma was recently honoured with two awards during a dinner in Durban held by Nafupa. He added that their support for Zuma was not meant to undermine the justice system. “We want to set a precedent and create a space for President Cyril Ramaphosa and many other presidents who will follow to not fear to stand on the side of the black and poor. “If we don’t stand up now and defend Zuma, who championed all these things for black people, it will mean that future presidents will fear tackling white monopoly capital head-on like Zuma did.”
