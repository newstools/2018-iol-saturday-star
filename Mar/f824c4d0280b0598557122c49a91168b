"Rugby is all I obsessed about, to be honest. I knew since I was a young boy that I wanted to play professional rugby. To become a professional sportsman is a dream shared by millions of people, but not everyone gets to fulfil their dream. "I don’t think I ever wanted to stop playing rugby. However, there was the occasional self-doubt especially in my younger years of whether I would be able to make a career out of playing rugby. “I was driven to succeed, however, and I was relentless in my pursuit of my dream.  "I’ve had to overcome several obstacles ever since I become a professional rugby player. From an individual perspective, in 2010 and 2011, being a junior player having to do pre-season with the senior team without being included in the playing squad was a mental battle for me. I’ve also picked up some injuries along the way I fractured my wrist in 2016 during the Super Rugby season. I was out of playing for four months. “My wrist broke in four places during the game against the Southern Kings in PE. "As a result, I missed out on a super rugby final against the Hurricanes in Wellington. The thing I fear the most is that every player's future is uncertain. Not always knowing what the future holds and when injuries can strike can be daunting at times. But overall, I have been very blessed.” (Ruan Dreyer - Joburg)
