 The world's best single images of 2017 have been revealed - and a number taken by South Africans are among them. This week the winners of 10 open categories and 63 national awards in the Sony World Photography Awards were unveiled by the World Photography Organisation. They were selected by a panel of judges from a record 320000 submissions from more than 200 countries. The subject matter of these contemporary photographs could not have been more diverse and include stunning landscapes, personal portraits, touching encounters, the natural world as well as sporting moments. Chairperson Zelda Cheatle said that in choosing the winners, the images all had to have something special - “whether it be composition, impact, skill, a portrayal of a unique event or informing in a new way. “Above all else, each winner had to be an exceptional photograph.” Many of the winners were non-professional photographers, making their achievement even more remarkable, she said. All open category and national award winners received the latest digital imaging equipment from the sponsor, Sony. In addition, the winning work will be published in the 2018 awards book and shown at the Sony World Photography Awards Exhibition in London from April 20 to May 6 in Somerset House. The awards have the power to change the lives of those who enter.
