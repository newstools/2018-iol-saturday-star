The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has issued a warning that there have been increased sporadic cases of Mango fly worm infestations in Gauteng and North West province. The Mango fly worms, also called Tumbu Fly or putsi fly, has maggots that burrow into skin. Professor John Frean of the Parasitology Reference Laboratory, at the NICD said the parasite is not dangerous but can cause boil-like sores. “These flies are not fussy, they will not only feed on humans but animals like dogs,” he said. The NICD, Frean said, has received numerous samples of the maggots which they had to identify. “The parasite is common in northern Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal,” he said, adding the last time there was such a big outbreak was in 2006. The Mango fly worm usually lays its eggs in urine or faeces contaminated sand, or on clothing. When the maggots hatch they penetrate the skin, leaving a hole through which the worm breaths. When the maggot reaches the end of its life cycle, it leaves the wound and falls to the ground where it pupates into an adult fly. Frean suggested the best way to get rid of the larvae is to apply Vaseline or liquid paraffin to the infected area. This suffocates the maggot forcing it to the skin’s surface. Then they can be squeezed out. Other ways of preventing the spread of the fly is by ironing clothes and not allowing washing to lie on the ground to dry. Dogs can be dipped in an insecticide solution. As temperatures cool down, the Mango fly worm is likely to retreat from Gauteng to be found in  warmer regions. Saturday Star
