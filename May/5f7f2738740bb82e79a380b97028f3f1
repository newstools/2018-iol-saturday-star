If mound-building termites destroy your home-grown tomatoes, do not despair. You can just eat them.
Wits University says yes to eating bugs. Well, not all bugs are edible but the Yebo Gogga exhibition proudly encourages you to eat grasshoppers, termites and mopane worms among others. Exhibition director Donald McCallum will have some to taste and you can decide if you have been missing out. Besides, these creepy crawlies are stacked full of proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals. Plus they are either cheap or free. “This weekend we will be making pizza out of mopane worms,” he said.

Beyond learning about insects and eating them, Yebo Gogga also has a host of experts who will deliver talks. Kim Wolhuter will be speaking about what he has learnt in his close relationship with the wild. Christine Sievers will look at plants, poison and people.
