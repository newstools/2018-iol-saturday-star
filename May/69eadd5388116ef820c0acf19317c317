Levels of interest in the royal wedding as well as wider feelings towards the royal family and its members has been examined. The survey included South Africans who have regular internet access and therefore represents that portion of the population rather than being fully representative. READ: Where to watch wall-to-wall coverage of the #RoyalWedding Which members of the royal family are liked the most? The survey, carried out online among adults aged under 65, finds that the Queen and Prince Harry are the most liked members of the royal family overall around the world, each picked by 23% on average.  Globally, next come the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, chosen by 17% and 18% respectively, and their children George and Charlotte (picked by 10% and 9%). In this question, respondents could choose more than one option. Different countries have their different favourites.  In South Africa, Prince Harry is the most liked member (42%), ahead of the Queen (30%).  25% of South Africans have regard for Prince William, and 23% for the Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine. Megan Markle has already gained affection from 19% of the South African population. The Queen is the most liked in ten of the 28 countries (including India, China and Brazil), while Prince Harry is the most popular in eight (including Britain, Australia, South Africa and Saudi Arabia). The Duchess of Cambridge is the most liked in the United States, while her husband is the most popular in France. When it comes to the upcoming wedding itself, around one in four (27%) worldwide say they are at least fairly interested in news about it. Interestingly, South Africans show the second highest interest levels (49%) after India (54%), much higher than the global average. Spain (8%), Sweden, Japan (both 12%), Serbia (13%) and France (15%) are least engaged. Just over a third of those in Great Britain say that they are interested in the royal wedding. What impact does the royal family have on the image of the UK? When asked what impact the royal family has on their views of Britain, around half on average (51%) say it makes no difference.  Amongst those who do have an opinion, though, the royal family does have a net beneficial effect, by 23% to 11%. In 22 of the countries surveyed, the impact on Britain’s reputation is more positive than negative – especially in Romania, with a net positive impact score (positive impact minus negative impact) of +33, India (+27), Malaysia (+26), Saudi Arabia (+25) and Brazil (+24). Views in France are finely balanced, while in four countries the royals have a net negative impact on views of Britain: Chile (-4), Spain (-5), Turkey (-6) and most notably Argentina (-10). South Africans also identify with the words powerful (40%) and self-confident (27%) when describing their perception of the UK that the British royal family reinforces. The majority of connected South Africans (54%) feel that the royal family makes them feel no different with regards to their feelings about the UK and 41% believe that it would make no difference if the royal family was abolished (compared to 38% globally). 35% of South Africans believe that it would be worse for our country to have a constitutional monarchy instead of an elected head of state. Almost a quarter (24%) believe that it would make the country better. Similarly, among the 17 countries that are republics, on average only 16% think having a constitutional monarchy instead of an elected head of state would be better for their future – 36% think it would be worse, and around a quarter feel that it would make no difference (28%) or don’t know (20%). Opinions are more split in India, where 31% think replacing their elected head of state with a monarchy like Britain’s would be better, and 29% worse.
