13-month-old Baby Eden, who was kidnapped on Wednesday in Brackendowns, Ekurhuleni, has been safely returned to his father and taken to a hospital for a medical examination. Eden was the surprise child, the fourth son who was named for the delight he brought his parents. He disappeared on Wednesday. The suspects called his parents demanding R6 million for his safe release. A money drop was planned on Thursday, but it failed to bring Eden back home. The PHO Trio Team was then asked to assist with a subsequent money drop which took place yesterday. An operational plan was put together by the team and the drop off was observed. When the team had sight of Baby Eden, a tactical takedown of the suspects was executed. Eden was safely returned to his father and taken to a hospital for a medical examination. Two suspects were arrested at the drop off point. After further investigations the family's domestic worker was also arrested with some of the earlier received ransom money. Further investigations led to the arrest of two other suspects as well as the vehicle, a red Nissan Sentra, used to transport Eden. All the suspects will be detained at Brackendowns SAPS and FCS Ekhuruleni West Cluster will investigate the case further. On Facebook, Eden’s mother, Bronwyn Laird, described him as the the “son I didn't know I wanted”. “You weren't our plan, you were greater than that. God imprinted you into our existence, just like that. You were a love song in progress,” she wrote. “Your name represents how we feel - delight.” The Saturday Star
