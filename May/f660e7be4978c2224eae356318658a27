Tomorrow is Africa Day, commemorating the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963. The umbrella body, which was later renamed the African Union, was set up as part of the continent’s quest for unity; independence; emancipation and liberation from colonial powers. This special newsletter features articles on some of the big issues facing African countries. Some are positive. Others are critical. What they all have in common is that they reflect the views of academics steeped in knowledge about the continent. On a positive note, Muchazondida Mkono explains why social media offers a powerful platform for telling stories with a positive turn, opening the door to counteracting decades of Afro-pessimism. And Alan Christoffels outlines a number of programmes and initiatives that are building the continent’s science muscle. From our archives, we feature articles that take stock of democracy in countries across the continent. Kealeboga J Maphunye explores why it’s so difficult to wean African leaders of their addiction to power while Romola Adeola looks at what lessons other countries can learn from The Gambia. A range of other topics are covered too, from the arts to the economy, health and the environment. The Conversation This article was originally published by The Conversation. You can read it here.
