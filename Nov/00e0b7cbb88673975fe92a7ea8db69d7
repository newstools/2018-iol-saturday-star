SEOUL: North Korea’s state media said leader Kim Jong-un inspected the site for testing a “newly developed cutting-edge strategic weapon”, South Korean Yonhap news service reported yesterday. North Korea’s Korea Central Broadcasting Station said without elaborating that the weapon which Kim saw tested was “researched and developed for a long time”, and that the test was successful, according to Yonhap. The news coincided with North Korea’s decision to extradite a US citizen. Bruce Byron Lowrance was detained since mid October after he crossed the border from China, state-run news agency KCNA said yesterday. The report said he claimed to be travelling for the US secret service. North Korea released three US citizens in May ahead of a summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump. Trump said the move was a sign of North Korea’s goodwill.  At the time of publication, it was not known what he thought of the new weapon’s test. Reuters
