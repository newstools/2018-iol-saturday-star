In this week’s A-Typical interview we feature Jeannie De Gouveia (Jeannie D), a South African actress, television personality and radio DJ. The 36-year-old is best known for her vocal talents on Good Hope FM radio and for her work as a presenter on Top Billing. She participated on the second season of Strictly Come Dancing as well as Tropika Smooth Fan, and is currently the host of Afternoon Express. She has also just released her own Gin range, “Finery Gin”. If you could bring one musician back from the dead, who would it be and why? I love music more than anything but there is no musician I would want to bring back from the dead because we hold onto those musicians through their music. But, there is no one I’d want to bring back from the dead more than Anthony Bourdain. I am his biggest fan. I absolutely love him. If you had to choose to live without one of your five senses, which one would you give up and why? That’s the hardest question in the world because we need all of our senses but the one I would probably be able to give up would be touch because I know I certainly couldn’t live without the others. If your house was burning and you could only save one item, what would it be and why? I would save a solid gold Omega watch that my grandmother gave me. That was a gift to her from my grandfather when they were very young so it’s vintage, it’s beautiful and my grandmother is one of my favourite people in the world. How would you spend a billion rand? I would be an amazing billionaire because I think very little in my life would change. I would have the same car. I would have the same friends. I would just have a bigger house and I would travel more. I would try and focus more on the education system and alleviating poverty. If you could dedicate your life to solving one problem, what problem would you chose? Education, education, education. I can’t speak enough on how important that is. The Saturday Star
