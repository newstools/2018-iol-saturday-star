If you are looking for something to spice up your life, there is nothing better than traditional peri-peri chicken, filled with Portuguese and Mozambican flavour. Peri-Peri Chicken 1kg of chicken pieces ½ cup olive oil ½ cup lemon Juice ½ cup vinegar  ¼ cup paprika 1 tsp dried peri-peri  1 tbs oreganum 2 cloves garlic finely chopped 3 bay leaves 2 tbsp brown sugar Salt and pepper to taste ¼ cup of fresh cream Method Mix olive oil, lemon juice, bay leaves, vinegar, paprika, peri-peri, garlic and sugar. Allow chicken pieces to marinade for at least two hours. Once the coals are ready place the chicken onto the centre of the grill. Close lid, open the air vents. Cook for 15 minutes, turn the chicken and baste with the marinade. Cook for another 15 minutes. Check to see if the chicken is cooked by cutting a slit into the chicken with a sharp knife.  Remember chicken needs to cook over a low heat to remain tender and juicy. Reduce the remaining marinade in a frying pan over a high heat setting. Once the sauce has reduced add the cream and stir with a wooden spoon. This will allow for the marinade to turn into a tasty peri-peri sauce to drizzle over your chicken before serving.
