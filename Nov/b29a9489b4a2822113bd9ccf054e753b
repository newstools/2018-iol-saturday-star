Johannesburg - Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane welcomed the arrest of a man who is believed to be the murderer of siblings in Tshepisong on the West Rand. He was arrested on Wednesday in Mombela, Nelspruit, by the Krugersdorp Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit. Police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the team had been following up information when they made the arrest. Muzi, 8, and his sister Elam Mdibi, 9, were found in a pit on October 1, behind Slovoville cemetery in Soweto. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they had been blindfolded. Their mother, Andiswa, had to identify them in the mortuary from clothes they were wearing on the day they disappeared. The two went missing on September 7, while playing outside their house. It is alleged Andiswaâ€™s ex-boyfriend abducted them.  She said he phoned her and said he would swop her for them and that he was going to kill her. He told her to arrange her own coffin and then handed the phone to Muzi, who told her to call the police. Those were the last words she heard from her son, Andiswa said. The community believed the man had fled to Mozambique, but Dlamini said he had remained South Africa. Dlamini said the suspect would be appearing in the Kagiso Magistrates Court on charges of murder and kidnapping on Monday. The Saturday Star
