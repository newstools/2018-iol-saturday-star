In this week’s A-Typical interview we feature Melinda Bam, an international model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss South Africa in 2011. Bam also represented South Africa in Miss Universe in 2012. Melinda is also a television personality and has been a presenter of popular TV shows such as Pasella and Wies Jou Poppie? If you were able to change one of your physical characteristics, which would it be and why? I don’t necessarily think I would change a characteristic because I’ve come to love myself and be okay with who I am, what I look like, flaws and all. I wouldn’t mind to have been a little taller in my Miss SA years. Would you rather be an amazing dancer or be great at maths? I would rather be an amazing dancer. You can pay someone to do your books, but you would never be able to have someone else dance on your behalf! How do you define love? The inexplicable divine experience of letting your guard down to bring out every emotion, effort, desire and dream to lavish upon a person. To want the best for him, seek out the beautiful, treasure the unique, protect the sacred, fortify in faith and celebrate in colour every part of a godly marriage and union. To offer this kind of love is the biggest selfless act and the greatest gift to give. If you were on death row, what would your final meal be? I would probably have braaivleis skaap chops with lemon, and a braaibroodjie. What was your first impression of your husband when you first met? I thought he was an absolute Greek god! Those shoulders, those eyes, and his playful demeanour was just a hot bun to my butter! Still to this day, after four years of marriage, my impression hasn’t changed! I really am the luckiest girl in the world! The Saturday Star
