Adults and teenage drivers assume that it takes only a few seconds to text and tweet. This is erroneous. When a driver texts while driving at 80km/* , an event that can consume 10 seconds, the driving distance covered is equal to the length of a soccer field.

According to international figures, thousands of young drivers die due to texting while driving. Texting while driving is 16 times more likely to cause a crash than drunk driving.
