If you are looking for a simple dish the family will love, this is it. I got this recipe from Aunty Rey 25 years ago when it made such an impression, and I still make it all the time. It is as if our golden oldie friends know all the secrets to simple lovely food. Less time in the kitchen, more time having fun. Aunty Rey’s Tuna Pie 2 tins tuna fish chunks 2 cups tinned mushroom soup 1 cup fresh cream 1 large packet balsamic vinegar chips 1 cup cheddar cheese, grated Heat oven 180ºC. Mix tuna, mushroom soup and fresh cream together. Place a generous layer of balsamic chips in a medium-sized oven proof dish. Next, layer tuna mixture, followed by another layer of chips. Finish dish with a layer of chips. Sprinkle cheese over the top. Bake for 25 mins. Serve hot with a side salad of your choice. The Saturday Star
