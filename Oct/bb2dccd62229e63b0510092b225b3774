JOHANNESBURG - City Power this week started a project to replace bypassed, faulty and old pre-paid meters across the city. The project will continue until the end of December. The areas for the first phase of the project include Alexandra and its surrounding areas, Randburg, Midrand and Reuven. “The main purpose of the replacement project is to ensure effective and efficient reading of meters, do away with those that often have communication errors, and ensure compatibility with City Power’s migration to the smart grid,” said the utility's spokesperson Isaac Mangena. The first suburbs to be tackled include Athol, Bramley, Highlands, Hyde Park, Blairgowrie, Bloubosrand, Bordeaux, Bromhof, Randjespark, Vorna Valley, Erand Gardens, Country View, Crown, Bassonia, Aspen Hills and Alan Manor. The benefit of prepaid meters is that customer are able to manage their own consumption, Mangena added, and urged customers to co-operate with City Power contractors who come to do the replacements. City Power is warning residents not to allow any person, technician or contractor onto their property without first verifying credentials with City Power’s security risk control unit on 0114907911 or 0114907553 or 0114907900. Employees and contractors will have a City Power identity card, which will be colour-coded.  Blue is for permanent employees. The card will display a photo of the employee or contractor, their name, identification number and expiry date. Residents are also urged to contact their councillors or regional director for more information. Customers who are not home when City Power representatives arrive at their properties to seek access for meter installation should contact the metering call centre at 0114907484 to make arrangements for visits outside office hours or over the weekend.
