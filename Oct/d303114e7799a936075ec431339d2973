Traffickers are using drugs to force a growing number of British people - often homeless or mentally ill - to work for them, says the Salvation Army, a charity supporting victims of modern slavery. It provided support services to almost 1900 people - including Albanian and Nigerian women trafficked for sex work and Vietnamese forced to grow cannabis - in one year up to July, 19% more than in the year before. “There is an increase in the number of British adults referred to us following forced criminality in dealing drugs,” said Kathy Betteridge, the charity’s anti-trafficking director. There are about 136 000 modern slaves in Britain, according to the Walk Free Foundation’s 2018 Global Slavery Index - about 10 times more than a 2013 government estimate. Most are trapped in forced labour, sexual exploitation and forced marriages. Thousands of children - some as young as 12 - are estimated to be used by gangs to carry drugs.
