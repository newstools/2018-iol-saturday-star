BRITAIN’s Prince Harry climbed Australia’s Harbour Bridge yesterday, accompanied by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, during a royal tour that broke with the usual staid routine of such events to involve him and his wife Meghan in a group hug on Bondi Beach. Harry and Morrison smiled as the black, grey and yellow flag of the Invictus Games was hoisted on the Sydney landmark on the eve of the international paralympic event, founded by Harry for military personnel wounded in action, which runs until October 27. “Well done, Harry. Fantastic for all the veterans,” said Facebook user Angela Doggett on the social media page of the company that organises the climbs.  Earlier, Harry and Meghan (the Duke and Duchess of Sussex), joined a group hug on Bondi Beach at an event organised by surfers to build awareness of mental health issues. “Harry said each and every one of us will experience poor mental health at some stage in our lives,” Charlotte Connell, one of the participants in the circle, told the Australian Associated Press. Harry, who has said he sought counselling in his late 20s to deal with the grief of losing his mother Diana, served in the British Army and campaigns to provide mental health help for soldiers who need it. The prince, wearing a garland of blue flowers round his neck, and Meghan one of pink, listened to speakers in the circle before the hug. Harry, who wore khaki trousers and blue shirt, and Meghan, in an ankle-length striped dress, had kicked off their shoes to sit with members of community group OneWave, whose members wore brightly-coloured shirts and flower garlands.
