Online sales of Nike apparel and shoes surged in the four days after quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick became the face of a new advertising campaign. Sales dipped in the same four-day period last year. Nike's Kaepernick ad debuted Monday afternoon, a US holiday, drawing immediate praise and ire from celebrities and customers alike. From Sunday through Wednesday, product orders rose 27%, according to digital-commerce researcher Edison Trends, which collects receipt data from over 200 online vendors. In the same four-day period last year, product orders dropped 2%. It's an early, if incomplete, look at how the world's largest sportswear company may fare after deliberately wading into a hot political topic. The decision to feature the former NFL player - he claims he's been illegally barred from the league for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial inequality - has already drawn multiple criticisms from President Donald Trump. On Friday morning Trump tweeted: “What was Nike thinking?” It's not a big mystery. Nike believes that the campaign will create more business than it loses. - Bloomberg
