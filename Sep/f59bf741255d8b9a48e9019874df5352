One of the biggest events on the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or intersex (LGBTI) social calendar is set to make a grand return next month - for four days. Johannesburg Pride will take place from October 25 to October 28. “It will kick off in typical Pride fashion with a Pride month launch party,” said Johannesburg Pride chair Kaye Alley. It has partnered with Out TV and the cable network secured a pop-up channel on DSTV to broadcast Joburg Pride celebrations. The channel will be available for a month on DStv channel 198 from October 4 to November 4. “The success of this month could culminate into a permanent dedicated channel for Out TV on the Multichoice platform, which would mean a massive step forward for our community,” said Alley. “Beyond the Closet”, a lifestyle conference, will kick off festivities on October 25, focusing on educating the community on LGBTI rights, health care and family planning. The “Fit and Fabulous” event will be held on October 26 and that evening, the highly anticipated Mister Pride of Africa gala dinner will showcase heroes in the LGBTI community. “Applications are open on our website,” said Alley. The Joburg Pride Parade and Festival will be held on October 27 at Melrose Arch in accordance with the theme “Come out and Colour the Street in our Diversity”.
